A Web Application that enable user management (list all, create, delete, edit) in our database via browser. 

---

## About application

The application has the same features as my application [Data Access Object](https://github.com/MaciejKuchciak/Data-Access-Object), but is supported by web browser, therefore I strongly recommend you to firstly get familiar with DAO App and insert database with respective tables and subsequently try out my web app.

The application based on an object-oriented data access layer is able to perform database operations depending on the command that has been chosen by the user. The data for our program is stored in a database called `DAO` in a table `users`. If you decided not to check out app Data Access Object, here you can find an [SQL insetion query](https://github.com/MaciejKuchciak/Data-Access-Object/blob/main/insertion.sql). Moreover please do not forget to configure Tomcat Server, [download here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi), to run views in your browser. With default Tomcat config you shoud run the app on address http://localhost:8080/user/list.

The application has the following features:
> - displaying all users
> - adding a new user
> - deleting an user
> - updating an user
> - loading data from a database at application startup
> - hashing user's password

In this project I received a large injection of practical knowledge and be more confident in aspects as:
> - MVC
> - Servlets
> - OOP
> - MySQL
> - Maven (Dependencies)
> - DAO classes.
